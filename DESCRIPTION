Description: Sensitivity to unmeasured biases in an observational study that is a full match.  Function senfm() performs tests and function senfmCI() creates confidence intervals.  The method uses Huber's M-statistics, including least squares, and is described in Rosenbaum (2007, Biometrics) <DOI:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2006.00717.x>.
